## Why vector

Vector is a mathematical library for python. In my search to understand artificial intelligence (AI) I strived to make my own neural network entirely from scratch. To do this I began with <a href = "https://numpy.org/">numpy</a> – a python library which is the “go-to” for mathematical things within python. As I started to make this program, I realised that I wanted more control over the objects and wanted to use them in such a way that would make sense for AI. So, I made my own library – vector – a simple vector library in python which holds the basic activation functions for neural networks, random generation, and of course a Vector object which is to be used in a way similar to `np.array`.
